# Loan Approval Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement  
Banks and financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications daily.  
Manual loan approval can be biased, time-consuming, and error-prone.  
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts whether a loan should be approved based on applicant details such as income, loan amount, credit history, and other factors.

  - Loan Amount
  - Loan Term
  - Credit History
  - Gender, Education, Marital Status, Employment, Property Area  
- Target variable: **Loan_Status** (`Y` = Approved, `N` = Not Approved)
